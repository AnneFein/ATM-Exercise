ATM Exercise

This is a React application that allows the user to deposit and withdraw cash from a simulated bank account, based on user inputs.

How to Run

This is a React application that runs in the browser. Node.js and npm need to be installed on the user's machine. A "npm start" command must also be used in order to launch the application, from Terminal. To use the ATM as a user, choose the desired option on the selector button (Deposit or Withdrawal), and enter the dollar amount in the input box that appears. The app will calculate the Account Balance based on these inputs.

Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to add functionality to this app, to allow for a deposit of up to two decimals (for instance, in the event of a check being deposited, with $X.XX cents included). At this point, this app only allows deposits of whole numbers. I would also like to add more styling to this app.
